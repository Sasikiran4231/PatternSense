->Automatic classification of patterns (e.g., stripes, floral, polka dots)
->Detection of irregularities or defects in textile patterns
->Supports use cases in fashion, textile quality control, and interior design
->Scalable deep learning model trained on diverse datasets
->User-friendly interface for pattern uploading and result visualization

🧰 Tech Stack:
->Python
->TensorFlow
->Deep Learning (CNNs)
->Data Preprocessing Techniques
->Supporting tools for image handling and visualization
